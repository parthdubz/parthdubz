# About Me
Student developer exploring the intersection of computer vision and large language models.  
I design end-to-end AI systems that integrate perception pipelines (OpenCV, MediaPipe), generative reasoning models (LLMs), and production-ready backend infrastructure. My focus is on building AI that is not only intelligent in isolation, but coherent and reliable as a complete system.

I’m particularly interested in:

• Multimodal AI systems  
• Real-time inference architectures  
• Human-AI interaction  
• Applied AI in healthcare contexts  

I treat every project as an experiment in system intelligence.
